Space Rangers is a 3D WebGL game that I developed during my internship at IIT Bombay. This game inspires user to answer maths questions as quickly as possible, in order to win the race. The questions are fetched from a JSON file which can be changed to have your own set of MCQ questions. The game was written in javascript without any game engine or framework used. The only javascript library used was three.js for handling WebGL. Play the game <a href="https://ekshikha-gamificationframework.github.io/Space-Ranger/index.html">here</a>(desktop version). Source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/ekShikha-GamificationFramework/Space-Ranger">github</a>.
