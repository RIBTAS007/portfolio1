This game was developed during the free code camp front end development certification course. 
This is [Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).
The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. 
Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. Play the game from link below (not for mobile).
