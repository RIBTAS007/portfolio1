This app was developed during the free code camp front end development certification course.
This app is a clock in which you can set two kinds of time. One is the session time and other is the break time period.
Both this time intervals would occur alternatively in the clock. Like if session time is 2 minutes and break time is 1 minutes 
then the clock timer would first run for 2 minutes then for 1 minutes and this pattern will keep repeating alternatively.
You can use the app from link below.
